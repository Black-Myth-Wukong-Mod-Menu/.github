# Black Myth: Wukong Mod Menu 

There are journeys meant to be endured… and journeys meant to be *understood*.
**Black Myth: Wukong Mod Menu** exists in that quiet space between struggle and mastery, where the Destined One learns not by brute force, but by patience, rhythm, and choice.

Created exclusively for **single-player use** in **Black Myth: Wukong**, this mod menu is a unified control panel — a brush with which you soften difficulty spikes, rehearse boss patterns, and explore the world without breaking its spell.

Not a shortcut.
A lantern.

## 🌒 Overview

The Mod Menu is an external, toggle-based interface that lets you adjust core gameplay systems **in real time**. It’s built to be readable, reversible, and respectful of the game’s tone.

Turn features on to *learn*.
Turn them off to *prove* what you’ve learned.
